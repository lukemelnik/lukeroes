This is my first blog post using **MDX** and Content Collections! MDX allows me to write regular Markdown with embedded React components.

## What Can You Do with MDX?

With MDX, you can:

1. Write normal Markdown content
2. Use **bold**, _italic_, and `code` formatting
3. Embed custom React components
4. Include syntax-highlighted code blocks

<CustomComponent />

## Code Example

Here's a simple TypeScript function:

```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet("World"));
```

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about music, touring, and other creative projects. Stay tuned!
